#  RecyBuddy is an open-source <img src="/photos/homeBold.png" width = 35 height = 35>
While developing RecyBuddy using react-native, there were many challenges such as get getting the **camera** and **audio** functions to work.
React Native has been updated numerous times which make finding valid resources extremely difficult. I wanted to make the RecyBuddy code to be an **open-source**
so that the next generation of coders could look at my work and hopefully utilize what I learned, and create even more radical apps which will change the world.

## Motivation
One day, after a family hike, my brother asked me where he should dispose his mask. I had to search through a couple articles in order to answer his
simple question. I realized that **Covid-19** had generated so much more trash because everyone was staying at home. According to the United States
Environmental protection agency, the average generated about **4.5 pounds** waste each day and the **recycling rates, including composting was 32%**. 
Theoretically the world would generate **8,008,000,000 pounds of trash *each day***.
## Why RecyBuddy was built
RecyBuddy was built in an attempt to assist people around the world to recycle right. Recycling comes with numerous benefits such as saving natural resources,
lessening the amount of trash sent to landfills, and lessening the amount of trash sent to the incinerator. These benefits can reduce global warming Global warming
is a huge problem which leads to higher temperatures, ocean acidification, more wildfires, water shortages, and weed and pest invasions. RecyBuddy was built
in attempt to help people **recycle right** which would ultimately keep our beloved planet healthy.
## What was learned
Through developing RecyBuddy I learned about the importance of recycling, increased my recycling knowledge, and increased my perseverance. I learned the importance of recycling and expanded my recycling knowledge. Items that are not recyclable with jam and break sorting machines at recycling centers, which would slow down the rate of recycling. Besides these minor problems, **not** recycling right poses a huge challenge, **Climate Change**. Non recyclables, such as food will contaminate other recyclables and make **recyclables unrecyclable**. This increases the amount of trash. Trash ends up in landfills or is incinerated. Creating landfills causes deforestation, which contributes to global warming, and incinerating trash also generates a tremendous amount of carbon dioxide which contributes to global warming. 

Additionally, through developing RecyBuddy, I expanded my own recycling knowledge. I researched through countless websites in order to compile over 300 items in my database. I hope to expand my knowledge as I continue to lengthen the database, and teach others about recycling.

Finally, I learned how to persevere through hard problems. I faced many technical errors such as core software(React Native, Yarn, Node) mismatch, Xcode errors, etc, which required me to sit down and focus for several hours in order to figure out the problem. Through the development of RecyBuddy, not only did I learn about recycling, but also **how to persevere through hard problems.**

## Why RecyBuddy stands out
RecyBuddy stands out because it provides **three** methods of scanning an item *and* a **fun and intuitive game** for users to play. At first, I tried out some other recycling apps, but found that the apps were complex and inaccurate. Many of the apps only supported **one** type of searching, had a **complex user interface**, and had **low accuracy** when searching itmes. RecyBuddy supports **three** searching methods, has a clean and simple user interface, and has
a high accuracy when searching items.

In addition to RecyBuddy's easy user interface and experience, RecyBuddy provides a fun and simple game. This really makes RecyBuddy stand out because 
almost **no other app provides an in app game**. This allows users, especially younger generations, to **learn** about recycling. This is crucial because the app
was developed in hopes of a world filled with people knowledgeable and enthusiastic about recycling.
