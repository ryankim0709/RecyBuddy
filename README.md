# RecyBuddy is an open-source
While developing RecyBuddy using react-native, there were many challenges such as get getting the **camera** and **audio** functions to work.
React Native has been updated numerous times which make finding valid resources extremely difficult. I wanted to make the RecyBuddy code to be an **open-source**
so that the next generation of coders could look at my work and hopefully utilize what I learned, and create even more radical apps which will change the world.
